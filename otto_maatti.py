# Program starts and asks for user's PIN-code

# TASK1:
# add here logic:
#    program should ask for pin 3 times, and quit if pin code was not correct.
#    !! consider using a while- or for-loop ... or goto??

# TASK2:
# add a suitable prompt for user. (suitable prompt: sopivanlainen kehoite teksti)
pincode = input("kerro...")

# TASK3:
# make sure pincode is of type int (integer)

try_count += 1 # keep score, how many times user has tried to input PIN-code

if (accounts.findWithPinCode(pincode)):

    # TASK4:
    # add here a call to "fetchBalance"-method in accounts-object, which returns the account balance
    # (balance: tilill√§ oleva summa)
    # !! example: accounts.fetchBalance()

    # TASK5:
    # add here code which prints the current balance for user

    # TASK6:
    # ask user what to do: WITHDRAWAL or EXIT

    # TASK7:
    # if user choce WITHDRAWAL, ask the amount and use the "Withdraw"-method
    # in accounts-object to update the account balance.

else:
    # TASK8: print a clear message for user that account is now locked.
    # !! it is not really locked...
    # BONUS: add code to account_manager.py to lock an account after too many attempts of wrong pin
